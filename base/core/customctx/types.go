// Package customctx provides a custom context implementation that extends
// Go's standard context.Context with the ability to accumulate structured errors
// throughout the execution flow. This is useful for collecting multiple errors
// that occur during processing without stopping execution, and for tracking
// where each error was registered in the call stack.
